The Python scripts help to get Ad Campaigns' engagements from Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. This code would work for a single business account that has run that particular ad campaign. 

The scripts upload data containing stats like impressions by city, impressions by age, impressions by gender, fans, likes, comments, followers, posts, and captions.

The scripts fetch data using the Facebook Graph API and the Twitter client and upload them to a Snowflake database for further analysis. 

The scripts can be modified further to fetch more metrics through the Facebook Graph API.
