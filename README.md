# social-media-stats


The Python script helps to get Ad Campaigns' engagements from Instagram and Facebook. This code would work for a single business account that has run that particular ad campaign. 

The script uploads data containing stats like impressions by city, impressions by age, impressions by gender, fans, likes, comments, followers, posts, and captions.

The script fetches data using the Facebook Graph API and uploads them to a Snowflake database for further analysis. 

The script can be modified further to fetch more data available through the Facebook Graph API.
